“Other platforms made the rules. I burned the rulebook.”

want me to turn this into:
	1.	a system architecture diagram (PNG + Mermaid),
	2.	a requirements PRD (Google-doc style),
	3.	and an RFP packet you can send to CCBill/Segpay/VerifyMy/GetStream/Resend?

I can drop those as files you can hand straight to your team.
